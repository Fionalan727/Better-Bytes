# Better Bytes (Lighthouse Labs Final Project)

## Main Contributors: Fiona Lan, Lucy Zhao and Mike Fyke


## Overview
Better Bytes was a passionately collaborative project, meant to provide users with delicious new meal ideas, sorted by the lowest price and location and finalized into a grocery list.
Users can browse through our library on recipes, sort in such categories as Budget Friendly, Easy Prep Meals or based on dietary needs like Vegetarian or Dairy Free. Once a user finds a recipe they would like to make they can simply click add to display the list of ingredients to our grocery list page. A user can now click over to their grocery list and see a listing of all their required grocery list items along with, individual and total pricing. The prices are calculated based on "One Stop Shopping", we want users to see where their dollar will go the furthest, in one stop. The user has the ability to select which store they would like to be displayed to compare prices for their convenience.
Lastly we have included and individual item search feature in our nav bar to be displayed on all pages. This feature allows a user to search for an item one at a time to receive an updated price check from listed stores. These are scraped at the time of a search and are sorted to display lowest prices first.
